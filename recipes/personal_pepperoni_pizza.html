				</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 
				<strong>1/2 cup</strong> of water in a 
				medium bowl; set aside for flavors to develop 
				while making crust. Freeze remaining paste.
			</li>
			<li>For crusts: Combnine <strong>2 cups</strong> of 
				flour with the dry yeast, sugar and salt. 
				Add the water and oil and mix until well 
				blended (about <strong>1 minute</strong>). 
				Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, 
				until a soft, sticky dough ball is formed.
			</li>
			<li>Knead for about <strong>4 minutes</strong>, on a 
				floured surface, until dough is smooth and 
				elastic. Add more flour, if needed. (If using 
				RapidRise yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 
				<strong>10 minutes</strong>.)
			</li>
			<li>Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured 
				hands) into a <strong>12-inch</strong> greased 
				pizza pan Or roll dough to fit pans.
			</li>
			<li>For pizzas: Preheat oven to 
				<strong>425 degrees F</strong>. Top crusts with 
				sauce, pepperoni and cheese.
			</li>
			<li>Bake for <strong>18 to 20 minutes</strong> until 
				crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly. For 
				best results, rotate pizza pans between top 
				and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.
