		</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>4 cups uncooked short-grain white rice
				</li>
				<li>4 1/2 cups of water
				</li>
				<li>1 cup of water
				</li>
				<li>1/4 teaspoon of salt
				</li>
				<li>1/4 cup of bonito shavings (dried fish 
					flakes)
				</li>
				<li>2 sheets nori (dried seaweed), cut into 
					1/2 inch strips
				</li>
				<li>2 tablespoons of sesame seeds
				</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>wash the rice in a mesh strainer until the water 
				runs clear. Combine washed rice and 
				<strong>4 1/2 cups</strong> of water in a 
				saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, 
				stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to 
				<strong>low</strong>; cover. Simmer rice until 
				the water is absorbed, which is about 
				<strong>15 to 20 minutes</strong>. 
				Let rice rest, about <strong>15 minutes</strong>
				 to allow the rice to continue to steam and 
				 become tender. Allow cooked rice to cool.
			</li>
			<li>Combine <strong>1 cup</strong> of water with the 
				salt in a small bowl. Use this water to dampen 
				hands before handling the rice. Divide the 
				cooked rice into <strong>8 equal</strong> 
				portions. Use <strong>one</strong> portion of
				rice for each onigiri.
			</li>
			<li>Divide <strong>one</strong> portion of ice into 
				<strong>two</strong>. Create a dimple in the 
				rice and fill with a <strong>heaping</strong> 
				<strong>teaspoon</strong> of bonito flakes. 
				Cover with the remaining portion of rice and 
				press lightly to enclose filling inside rice 
				ball. Gently press the rice to shape into a 
				triangle. Wrap shaped onigiri with a strip of 
				nori. Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Repeat to 
				make a total of <strong>8</strong> onigiri
